Using a line scan sensor sourced from industrial surplus, I prototyped and built a multi-axial line scanning camera. Splicer is grounded in the physical world and is lens-based as it captures a constant stream of physical light reflected off the real samples in front of the lens. The photographs resulting from splicer are though no direct representations of a physical scene. They are condensations from specific moments in this constant flow of data. These photographs are a non-linear translation in the dimensions of space and time exhibiting a new granular perspective. Splicer tries to bridge the gap between lens-based photography and higher orders of photographic image production common to the post-photographic era.</p>"}]}
